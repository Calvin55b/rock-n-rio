      <h3>Destinations</h3>
      <p>The top destination for families and travelers alike is the famous Jardim Botânico! Located in the Jardim Botânico district near the Horto, this renowned Botanical Garden was established in 1808 with the purpose of cultivating plants from around the world in Brazil. Today, it is home to over 6,000 species of tropical and subtropical plants, offering a unique glimpse into Brazil's vibrant biodiversity. It's a wonderful spot to immerse yourself in the natural beauty of the country and discover the rich variety of flora that Brazil has to offer.

        <p>The next top destination on our list is Sugarloaf Mountain! Towering over Rio's coast, this iconic peak rises more than 1,000 feet above the Atlantic Ocean. In 2008, a cable car was built to connect Sugarloaf Mountain to neighboring Urca Mountain, spanning an impressive 4,500 feet. This ride offers breathtaking views of Rio's cityscape and is a fantastic spot for photos, capturing the stunning skyline and ocean views.</p>

      <h3>Safety</h3>
      <p>
        While Rio de Janeiro is breathtakingly beautiful, it can be dangerous if precautions aren't taken. A few simple tips can help ensure a safe visit. First, prioritize self-awareness in public areas. Avoid wearing extravagant clothes or flashy jewelry, and keep personal items close—never leave them unattended. Also, it's best to avoid carrying large sums of cash.
        </p>
        <p>
        Stick to public, well-populated areas, and try to return to your accommodations by 10 p.m. or earlier, as Rio tends to be riskier at night. By following these simple guidelines, you can enjoy Rio's beauty while minimizing potential risks!

      <p>         
        On my destinations page I am planning on adding how much it is going to cost to travel. This would help prospective travelers be more aware of which atractions they should prioritize based on the cost.
